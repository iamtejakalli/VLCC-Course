### What is Esthiology?

Esthiology is the study and practice of skin care and beauty treatments. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and services designed to improve skin health and appearance, including:

- **Facials**: Cleansing, exfoliating, and treating the skin.
- **Waxing**: Hair removal from various parts of the body.
- **Makeup Application**: Enhancing natural beauty with cosmetics.
- **Skincare Treatments**: Addressing issues like acne, aging, or dryness.
- **Body Treatments**: Such as wraps or scrubs to exfoliate and rejuvenate the skin.

Estheticians (practitioners of esthiology) are trained professionals who provide these services in spas, salons, dermatology offices, or wellness centers. They also educate clients on proper skincare routines and recommend products for home use.

### Starting an Esthiology Course as a Beginner

1. **Research Licensed Schools**  
   Look for accredited esthiology or cosmetology schools that offer esthiology programs. These are often recognized by your state’s cosmetology board.

2. **Understand Licensing Requirements**  
   Every state has different requirements for becoming a licensed esthetician. Typically, you’ll need to:
   - Complete a state-approved esthetics program.
   - Pass a licensing exam (often includes a written and practical portion).

3. **Enroll in a Beginner Program**  
   Beginner programs typically cover:
   - Anatomy and physiology of the skin.
   - Basics of skincare and product chemistry.
   - Practical training in facials, waxing, and other techniques.

4. **Obtain Necessary Supplies**  
   Many programs include a kit with tools and products, but you may need to purchase additional items like:
   - Professional-grade skincare products.
   - Tools for facials, waxing, and makeup application.

5. **Commit to Hands-On Training**  
   Training programs emphasize practical, hands-on experience. Be prepared to work on peers and models to refine your skills.

6. **Complete the Program and Get Licensed**  
   After completing the required hours and coursework, you’ll be eligible to take your state licensing exam. Passing this exam allows you to work professionally.
